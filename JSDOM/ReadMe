This program filters the UFO-sightings by Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. 
The filter data can be entered in the field on the left. If the field is empty it will be ignored.
A refresh will display the complete dataset and eliminate all data-filtration entries. 

There is currently no entry control for the filter, so if, for example, US is entered
for Country (instead of us) there will be no display.

If there are multiple filters, they will be connected by a logical 'and'.
